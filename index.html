                    <p>This is just my way of thanking you for all the support and care you've given me.
                    These pictures are the ones that I took on our dates. <br>Read everything and then give me your answer on the last one.

                    <p>was not looking for love. I was this man who's scared to love again. The man who lost his way once. I keep reminding myself that I need no one and that 
                        can take care of myself. I never seek help from anyone because I thought, on my own, I can. Then came- </p>

                    <p>found me and made me feel alive again. I think it's crazy that you made me feel so comfortable around you, that you get to see how childish I could be.
                    What's even more crazy is how much I trust you, when I know the fact that I can't trust anybody. You made me feel-

                    <p>is the best place anyone could be. But sadly, not for me. I can't believe that I openly talked about it with you, without me worrying how'd you feel. As time goes by,
                        you're making me feel safe, and taken care of. How long since I have felt this kind of genuine-

                    <p>the way you cling to me, and make me feel shy in public. I love the way you smile at me in front of your dormitory. I love the way you laugh at my jokes, and
                    the way you tell me I'm handsome even though I know I don't. I love the way we treat each other, I hope time stop whenever we're together. I will always do everthing I could,
                    because I want you to stay-

                    <p>may not be enough to let you know how much I want to be with you. I would never promise you uncertain things. The only thing that I could promise you is that- I will always 
                        be here for you. I will always be your home. I will always be your number 1 supporter in everything you do. I will always take care of you and make sure you are safe.
                        I will always love you as long as I can, and I will promise you that I will always be honest a hundred percent. I love you, Shaine. I am so damn inlove with you.
